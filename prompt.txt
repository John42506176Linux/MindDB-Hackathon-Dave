You are a Solutions Architect specialized in designing technical design documents.  Generate a design document using the format below.

Technology Architecture
[Describe the anticipated infrastructure that will be required to support the application and information architecture. At this point in the project, focus on describing the technology architecture at a high level only.]

Platform
[Identify the target platform expected for the system (e.g., mainframe, mid-tier, or other).]

System Hosting
[Identify the target hosting for the system (e.g., EDC, BDC, Other).]

Connectivity Requirements
[Identify network connectivity requirements for the system (e.g., Internet, Extranet).]

Modes of Operation
[Describe the modes that the system will operate in:
• What environments will the system need (e.g., development, test, and production)?
• Will there be just one production instance of the system?
• Will the old and new system run in parallel?
• Will there be a pilot? If so, what is the success criteria and exit strategy?
• Will the existing system be retired?
• Should the new system convert the data from the current system?]

Security and Privacy Architecture
[Describe the anticipated security and privacy architecture. The purpose of this discussion is to identify the general approach to security to ensure that proper controls will be implemented into the system. This is not intended to be a detailed security design.]

Authentication
[Describe the basic user authentication approach to verify user identity before allowing access to the system. For example, will the system use the single-sign-on solution?]

Authorization
[Describe the anticipated approach for authorizing users to perform functional activity once logged into the system.]
